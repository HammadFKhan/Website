          Topographical Effects in Neuronal Calcium Signaling
        </div>
        <p>
          Much of my undergraduate work has revolved around designing and fabricating
          microenvironment
          to observe neuronal growth and communication. Particularly looking at how perturbations
          in
          various physical topographies effect calcium communication. So why start there? To
          begin,
          we
          need to first take a look at how the human brain develops and changes over time. It is
          no
          means a flat plane, rather the neocortex is filled with these "hills and valleys".
          Biological
          evolution has allowed our brains to attain a very large volume relative to surface area.
          Hilgetag and Barbas explain this very well. If we can model the finer topographical
          structures
          in the human cortex on a petri dish, then it stands that we can learn some of the
          factors
          that
          play a role in the morphology of cellular communication and subnetworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why am I, an electrical engineer, researching this? Well, currently there is a
          multitude
          of techniques that capture neuronal development and communication in vitro. However,
          systemically elucidating neuronal communication using a curvature confinement within a
          petri
          dish has not been done. How does different bending affect the way that cells signal each
          other? What about cellular growth? When I first joined Kunze Neuroengineering lab on the
          summer of my junior year, microfabricating devices provided an avenue of interest. My
          advisor,
          Dr. Anja Kunze, thought it would be a great start to point me towards fabricating
          biocompatible microstructures to observe the way the neurons grow and communicate. At
          twenty
          years old I set off to piece together how to create a device that can do just that. </p>

        <p>In hindsight I realize that much of my journey started off as any other researcher:
          absolute
          perplexity. Given the fact that I was several decades behind current neuroengineering
          methods,
          I had a lot of catching up to do. Eventually I settled on rerunning a couple of old
          experiments on agarose hydrogel. I later figured out that agarose was very
          straightforward
          to
          implement in cell culture systems. Given its thermo-responsive nature, it was also
          relatively
          easy to fabricate and best of all biocompatible. Much of my junior year was studying how
          neurons interacted with agarose. Eventually, I moved on to designing some sort of
          structure
          that can use agarose as a barrier to facilitate confine growth between neuronal
          networks.
          In
          collaboration with another undergraduate (now graduate student), we designed a
          high-throughput
          cell assay that allowed neurons to growth within their own confined curvatures using
          agarose
          hydrogels as a means of fabrication. This was when the project took off and now, six
          months
          later, the results that we obtained describes neuronal communication much better than we
          had
          any right to expect.

          Elucidating Fundamental Biological Functions at Single-Cell Resolution
        </div>
        <p>
          I am very interested in answering three questions in the neuroengineering field. First,
          can
          we
          rationally build a close-loop system that allows us to observe as many stages of the
          cellular
          network as we can? Secondly, how can we holistically quantify perturbations from single
          cell
          or sub-network communication? Thirdly, how can we better communicate our respective
          scientific
          discoveries to scientists of all fields? Since much of my work has been revolved around
          in
          vitro studies, I am curious on how to best translate discoveries between in vitro and in
          vivo.
          Much of these questions revolve around breaking down what we already know about the
          methods
          of
          each respective experimentation. There are several complications that arise from in vivo
          experimentation. There is a limitation on how invasive we want the device to be to study
          brain
          models, additionally there is the challenge of explaining the biological impacts of
          invasive
          methods. Temporally advantageous long term studies also restrict the repetition on how
          many
          times we can conduct the same experiment or if we want to test against a control.
          Remember
          systematic research requires changing only one variable at a time. As a result we see
          that
          in
          vitro studies prove promising in understanding sub-cellular environments of cell growth
          and
          communication. High throughput analysis can be done with rapid repeatability. The
          problem
          is
          translating any of these findings to in vivo models can lead to unreliable conclusions.

        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore can we design a device that accurately mimics the in vivo environment of the
          human
          brain while simultaneously conducting temporally intensive high throughout experiments
          with
          high repeatability?
        </p>
        <p>
          Disclosure: Since I have only been conducting neuroengineering research for two years
          much
          of
          my interest could change as I become more exposed to different methods and fields. But
          for
          now
          this is what I can envision my research going.

          Novel Techniques in Controlling Sub-Cellular Behaviors
        </div>
        <p>
          Magnetic nanoparticles are a versatile tool to modulate calcium signaling, alter
          intracellular
          vesicle dynamics, or interfere with gene expression in cerebral neurons through imposing
          magnetic field gradients on the nanoparticles
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we are working on characterizing nanoparticle movement under define magnetic
          field
          patterns. Since magnetic interaction with neurons depend heavily on spatial information,
          quantifying how nanoparticles move through different magnetic field gradients is of much
          interest. Here we presented a method on how to track nanoparticle movement using
          particle
          image velocimetry (PIV). Additionally, we have found that inducing nanoparticle movement
          can
          influence cellular growth and orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this application, I am part of a biotechnological startup in hopes to
          commercialize
          a
          product that our team has been working on. It is definitely an exciting venture for me â€“
          I
          have never been a part of a business driven project, and I hope we can push this project
          forward based on the previous research that we have done.
